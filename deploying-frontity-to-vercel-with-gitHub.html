                <h1>Deploying Frontity to Vercel with GitHub</h1>

                <p>
                    I&#39;m a big fan of Frontity, and one of the things I
                    really like is the ease of hosting the frontend. I chose
                    Vercel out of the options available, and could not be
                    happier with the choice. But one thing that I could not find
                    much information on was deploying the site to Vercel with
                    GitHub.
                </p>

                <p>
                    That&#39;s why I&#39;m writing this article, so that you can
                    learn to deploy Frontity to Vercel with GitHub. When I first
                    tried it, I got an error that the build could not be
                    completed because it did not find a public folder. So I gave
                    up for a bit, and just went back to deploying with the CLI.
                    But today I sat down and tried for real.
                </p>

                <p>
                    After searching for a while in the community, I found
                    nothing. So I decided to just try my luck. I have been
                    messing around in the project settings for Vercel before, so
                    I started there again. Under the general tab of the project
                    settings, I found “Build & Development Settings”. Here I
                    entered the frontity build commands, instead of the default
                    ones.
                </p>

                <p>
                    And that did the trick, when I added a new commit to my main
                    branch, Vercel made a new production commit, and it was
                    deployed successfully. So here are the steps you need to
                    take to make it work:
                </p>

                <h2>Change the Build & Development Settings</h2>

                <p>
                    First, you need to change the Build & Development Settings,
                    you can do this in the project settings, under the general
                    tab. Switch the button on the right of every field to
                    override, and then enter the following for each field:
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Under framework, select “other”</li>
                    <li>Build command -&gt; frontity build</li>
                    <li>Output directory -&gt; /</li>
                    <li>Install command -&gt; npm install</li>
                    <li>Development command -&gt; frontity dev</li>
                </ul>

                <p>When you have changed all the settings, click save.</p>

                <h2>Connect Vercel to Github</h2>

                <p>
                    The next step is to connect Vercel to GitHub, you can do
                    this in the project settings under the git tab. Just select
                    GitHub, and go through the steps and connect your account.
                </p>

                <p>Before you click, it should look something like this:</p>

                <p>
                    And after you have gone through the steps and selected a
                    repo, it should look like this:
                </p>

                <p>
                    PS! If you want to deploy from a GitHub organization, you
                    need
                    <a
                        target="_blank"
                        rel="noreferrer noopener"
                        href="https://vercel.com/pricing"
                        >Vercel Pro</a
                    >.
                </p>

                <h2>Make a commit to the repo</h2>

                <p>
                    Now all that remains is to make a commit to the repo. By
                    default, Vercel sets the production branch to “main”, so if
                    you use something else, like for instance “master”, you need
                    to change that in the project settings as well, under the
                    git tab.
                </p>

                <p>
                    So now, every time you make a commit to the production
                    branch, Vercel will automatically make a production
                    deployment with that brach. And if you want to preview
                    something that you have done, you can create a new branch,
                    and commit it. Vercel will then automatically make a preview
                    deployment of that brach.
                </p>

                <p>
                    PS! Make sure that you include the vercel.json file in the
                    repo, the deployment won&#39;t work without it.
                </p>

                <pre style="margin: 0; line-height: 125%">{
    <span style="color: #007700">&quot;version&quot;</span>: <span style="color: #0000DD; font-weight: bold">2</span>,
    <span style="color: #007700">&quot;builds&quot;</span>: [
        {
            <span style="color: #007700">&quot;src&quot;</span>: <span>&quot;package.json&quot;</span>,
            <span style="color: #007700">&quot;use&quot;</span>: <span>&quot;@frontity/now&quot;</span>
        }
    ]
}
</pre>

                <p>
                    So that&#39;s it, that&#39;s how you deploy Frontity to
                    Vercel with GitHub. If you have any questions, feel free to
