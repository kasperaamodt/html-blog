                <p>
                    Today is an exciting day for me. My company Aamodt Group has
                    always been a side project for me, but as of today, I'm
                    going to work on it full time. As a part of this, I'm also
                    changing the company's name from Aamodt Group to Accelr.
                    When I started this little side gig, I wanted to have my
                    last name in the company name, inspired by Robert Herjavec
                    in Herjavec Group.
                </p>

                <p>
                    But now, my priorities are different, and so are my goals. I
                    want to start a company that grows into something bigger
                    than me. So that's why I'm changing the name to Accelr.
                    Accelr, shortened from accelerating, based on my goal for
                    all the customers we work for:
